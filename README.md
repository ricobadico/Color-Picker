# Color-Picker
For Udemy's "Complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery" Course, Exercise 131

This webpage generates its own gradient background, based off of two user color inputs or a randomizing button. Added functionality to basic background generator to include randomized function and proper initial setup.

I went about creating the random functionality by creating random rgb values and feeding them into the gradient generator function. In hindsight, a search online could have led me to functions creating a random hex value, which would have been more elegant and could have been directly set the color input's values (which accept hex but not RGB).
